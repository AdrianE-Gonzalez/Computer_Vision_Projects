# To implement Median filtering 3x3 and 5x5) on a noisy image. 
# This can be done by finding the window of pixels around the pixel to be changed, sort them, and select the median value as the replacement of that pixel. 
# Apply the algorithm on an impulsive noise of 10% p probability of noise equally divided among salt and pepper.
